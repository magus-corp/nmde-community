## Developpment Loop

1) Evaluate: Always think in what you will do, how you will do it and the conseguences
- Commit-
2) Plan: After thinking, write your plan.
- Commit-
3) Reevaluate: After planing think again. Remember the wisdom of michelangelo and the marble stone:
      Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it.
      I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.
  We are chiseling away the raw caos of creation, take your time in the planning because in life and war usually we only need a good or few good strikes.
- Commit-
4) Implement: Do the work with purpuse and with the gods by your side.
- Commit-
5) Reevaluate.
- Commit-
OBS: You always commit.

We use for versioning:
git add -A .

We use for packages:
uv add packages
uv sync
