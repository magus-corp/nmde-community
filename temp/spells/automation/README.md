# Automation Spells

This directory is intended for "spells" that run as automated tasks, daemons, or are integrated into larger automated workflows.

## Available Spells

*(Currently empty, but will house scripts like `pulse_daemon.sh` if moved here, or other future automation scripts.)*

## Usage

Automation spells are typically configured to run automatically via systemd services, cron jobs, or other process managers. Refer to individual spell documentation for specific setup instructions.
